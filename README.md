# 3D House Project





3D lookup of houses: If you're on my map you're getting plotted.

### Nice-to-have features

- Optimize your solution to have the result as fast as possible--> Not sure how to do, unless cutting up the tiff, but would require
prior knowledge of coordinates.
- Features like the living area of the house in mÂ², how many estimated floors, if there is a pool, the vegetation in the neighborhood --> did not figure out/get registered in time for kadaster info.
- Better visualization.--> even better?


## Deliverables

1. Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.
2. Pimp up the readme file--> feels like i'm doing that now
	- What, Why, When, How, Who.
	- Pending things to do--> beat google maps as leading 3d mapper service
3. Show us your results in a nice presentation.
4. Show us a live demo

### Steps
1. Create the repository         v
2. Study the request (What & Why ?)   v
3. Download the maps    v
4. Identify technical challenges (How ?)  v
